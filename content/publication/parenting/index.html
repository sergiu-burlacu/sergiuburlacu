abstract: "Empirical evidence on human capital of children indicates a strong correlation between low socio-economic status and poor parental investment. This pattern is commonly attributed to lack of knowledge, resources or wrong beliefs on the returns to investment among such parents. This paper tests an alternative mechanism, based on scarcity: that pressing immediate financial concerns of poor parents capture their mental bandwidth, reducing their attention to important but less urgent parenting tasks. Using an online survey experiment, we study how financial concerns affect parental purchase decisions across three categories of goods and their responsiveness to discounts for child investment goods. We find that when offered a pure discount on child investment goods, all parents, rich and poor, respond rationally by spending more on them.  However,triggering financial concerns leads to a divergence in their response: richer parents continue to demand more of child investment goods, but poorer parents shift purchases to household necessities, away from child investment goods and also personal goods. Our results show that mental bandwidth challenges (i.e. scarcity) could be a distinct reason why poor parents don't invest sufficiently in their child's human capital despite financial incentives, independent of their knowledge or beliefs."
